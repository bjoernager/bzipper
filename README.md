[`bzipper`](https://crates.io/crates/bzipper) is a binary (de)serialiser.

Contrary to [Serde](https://crates.io/crates/serde/)/[Bincode](https://crates.io/crates/bincode/), the goal of this crate is to serialise data without inflating the resulting binary sequence.
As such, one may consider this crate to be more low-level.

Keep in mind that this project is still work-in-progress.

This crate does not require any dependencies at the moment.
