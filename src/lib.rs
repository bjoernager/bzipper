//! Binary (de)serialisation.
//!
//! Contrary to [Serde](https://crates.io/crates/serde/)/[Bincode](https://crates.io/crates/bincode/), the goal of `bzipper` is to serialise data without inflating the resulting binary sequence.
//! As such, one may consider this crate to be more low-level.
//!
//! Keep in mind that this project is still work-in-progress.
//!
//! This crate does not require any dependencies at the moment.
