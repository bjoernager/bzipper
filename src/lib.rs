//! Binary (de)serialisation.
//!
//! Contrary to [Serde](https://crates.io/crates/serde/)/[Bincode](https://crates.io/crates/bincode/), the goal of `bzipper` is to serialise with a known size constraint.
//! Therefore, this crate may be more suited for networking or other cases where a fixed-sized buffer is needed.
//!
//! Keep in mind that this project is still work-in-progress.
//!
//! This crate does not require any dependencies at the moment.
//!
//! # Data model
//!
//! Most primitive types serialise losslessly, with the exception being [`usize`] and [`isize`].
//! These serialise as [`u16`] and [`i16`], respectively, for portability reasons.
//!
//! Unsized types, such as [`str`] and [slices](slice), are not supported.
//! Instead, [arrays](array) should be used.
//! For strings, the [`FixedString`] type is also provided.
