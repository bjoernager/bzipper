/// This type is intended as a partially-generic decode error for collections.
/// It supports denoting an error for when the collection's length is invalid -- see the [`BadLength`](Self::BadLength) variant -- and when an element is invalid -- see the [`Item`](Self::BadItem)) variant.
///
/// The most common form of this type is <code>CollectionDecodeError<[Infallible](core::convert::Infallible), [ItemDecodeError](crate::error::ItemDecodeError)<[usize], ..></code>, but this may not always necessarily be the preferred form.
///
/// An example of a type using a different form is [`SizedStr`](crate::SizedStr), which uses <code>CollectionDecodeError<[`LengthError`](crate::error::LengthError), [Utf8Error](crate::error::Utf8Error)></code>.

	/// Sometimes the length isn't even encoded in the stream (instead lying in the type signature), and in these cases the appropriate type would also be `Infallible`.
